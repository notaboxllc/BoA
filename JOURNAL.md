## Project Goal

Replace Java3D visualization with a JSON + Three.js browser viewer, then GPU-accelerate the simulation using TornadoVM. The two goals are linked: Java3D must be removed before Java 21 can be used, and Java 21 is required by TornadoVM.

---

## Status

- **Java3D removal: COMPLETE** (Sessions 3–8). No `javax.media.j3d` imports anywhere in the codebase. The class-load-time blockers (`BranchGroup G`, `TransformGroup g3d` in `Thing.java`) are gone. Twenty-one pure-rendering files were deleted. The remaining 22 simulation files compile and run without Java3D jars on the classpath.
- **Three.js viewer + JSON output: WORKING** (Sessions 1–2). Per-frame `frame_NNNNNN.json` files render in `sim_viewer_boa.html` with actin segments, myosin parts, mini-filaments, and nucleotide-state coloring. Live scale sliders for biological size adjustment.
- **Phase 5 (Java 21 build): PENDING.** Java 21 is required by TornadoVM, and Java3D was the blocker. Now that Java3D is gone, the only thing remaining for Phase 5 is `brew install openjdk@21` on the MBP and validating that the codebase compiles and runs under `--release 21 --enable-preview`. After that, GPU work can begin (the planning for which is preserved in CLAUDE.md's "GPU Acceleration Strategy" section).

---

## Session 1 — JSON output + initial viewer (April 2026)

### Architecture documentation (CLAUDE.md)

Created `CLAUDE.md` from scratch. It covered build/run, the simulation object hierarchy (`Thing`, `FilSegment`, `Monomer`, connectors), the `ThreadSet` multithreading model and 12-phase loop, and the GPU acceleration strategy derived from Sim3D lessons.

### JSON frame output (ThreeJSWriter)

**New file:** `boxOfActin/ThreeJSWriter.java`

Writes per-frame JSON files (`frame_000000.json`, `frame_000001.json`, ...) in a format compatible with the Three.js viewer:

```json
{"frame":N, "t":T, "bounds":{"xDim":X,"yDim":Y,"zDim":Z},
 "segments":[{"end1":[x,y,z],"end2":[x,y,z],"r":0.035},...]}
```

On first write: resolves the output directory (auto-incrementing `.001`, `.002`... if the requested name already exists), then archives all `.java` sources to `source.zip` in the output directory for reproducibility.

Only live FilSegments (`removeMe == false`) are written. `end1` and `end2` are kept current by `FilSegment.initialize()`, which is called every step inside `moveThing()`, so they are always valid at output time.

**Modified:** `boxOfActin/Env.java` — added `static String threeJSOutputDir = null`.

**Modified:** `boxOfActin/BoxOfActin.java`
- `parseArgs()`: `-3js <dir>` flag sets `Env.threeJSOutputDir`; added to `-help`
- `updateCounters()`: increments `threeJSCounter`
- `logAndDraw()` and `remoteLog()`: both check `threeJSCounter >= toFileInterval` and call `ThreeJSWriter.writeFrame()`, so output works in both GUI and headless (`-r`) modes
- Initial counter value `(int)1e6` ensures frame 0 is written at time zero

### Three.js viewer (sim_viewer_boa.html)

Adapted from `~/Dropbox/CodeSync/Sim3D/sim_viewer.html`. Cylinders rendered as instanced `CylinderGeometry(1,1,1,8)`, scaled to `(r, length, r)` and rotated via `quaternion.setFromUnitVectors(yAxis, dir)` where `dir = end2 - end1`. Box wireframe via `BoxGeometry → EdgesGeometry → LineSegments`. Camera initial `z = 15` for a 10×10 micron box. HUD shows frame number, simulation time, segment count. MAX_SEGMENTS: 50,000.

### HTTP server (sim_server.py)

Copied verbatim from Sim3D. Scans subdirectories for `frame_000000.json`, serves them as static files, exposes `GET /api/simulations` for the viewer's auto-discovery dropdown.

---

## Session 2 — Myosin Visualization & Viewer Polish (May 2026)

### JSON output extended (ThreeJSWriter.java)

Frame JSON now includes three arrays — `segments`, `myosins`, and `minifilaments`. Myosin entries describe the rod, lever, and motor as sub-objects with their own end1/end2; the motor carries a `state` string (NONE/ATP/ADPPi/ADP) and an `onFil` flag. `rod.invisible` reflects `MyoRod.rodInvisible` — viewer skips rendering these (they are bundled inner rods of mini-filaments, represented instead by the single `minifilaments` cylinder).

### Parameter file gotchas

The `Parameter` class uses two independent fields:
- **isActive()** — whether the parameter is applied (the `true`/`false` in the file). If `false`, the parameter falls back to its Java default regardless of the value field.
- **getValue()** — the actual value (`1.0` = boolean true, `0.0` = boolean false)

`makeCrucible()` logic:
```java
if (bugShapedCrucible.isActive() && !simOutsideBug.isActive())
    Bug.makeABugCrucible();   // pill-shaped arena
else
    Chamber.makeABox();        // rectangular box
if (simOutsideBug.isActive())
    Bug.makeListeriaBug();     // Listeria inside box, with ActA
```

The `bugOff` parameter does NOT control bug creation — it's a red herring. Use `simOutsideBug:false:0.0` to suppress `Bug.makeListeriaBug()`.

### Viewer feature set

Geometry: actin segments magenta `#cc44bb`; myosin rods (dimers only, non-invisible) gray `#888888`; lever arms light blue `#88ccff` rendered as ellipsoids with minimum-length enforcement; motor heads as scaled ellipsoids colored by nucleotide state (NONE blue, ATP yellow, ADPPi orange, ADP red); mini-filament rods white `#ffffff`. Controls: left-drag to rotate, pinch-zoom, shift+scroll to pan, play/pause, frame scrubber, 2/10/30 fps buttons, collapsible Display panel with live scale sliders.

Biological note: Java3D rendered actin at `actinWidth/4 = 0.002 µm` (a visual-clarity reduction). Three.js viewer now uses true biological scale `0.008 µm` with slider override.

## Session 3 — Java3D Removal Survey (May 2026)

**Commit:** `260418f` "Session 3: Java3D removal survey — complete file inventory, phase plan, caller graph"

**Addendum commit:** `aee76af` "Session 3 addendum: QK deletion catalog, plusGhost notes, revised phase plan (0-5)"

Claude Code performed a complete file inventory, identifying every Java3D-using file in the codebase, mapping the call graph for graphics-dependent methods, and proposing a 6-phase removal plan:

- **Phase 0:** Pt3D surgery — sever the inheritance from `javax.vecmath.Point3d`
- **Phase 1:** Remove class-load-time Java3D triggers from simulation classes (field declarations like `BranchGroup G`)
- **Phase 2:** Strip Java3D from the remaining simulation files (FilSegment, Monomer, Myosin, etc.)
- **Phase 3:** Strip Java3D from `BoxOfActin.java` and `FileOps.java`; remove graphics orchestration, QK code, and Swing timer
- **Phase 4:** Delete pure-rendering files (Control panels, BoxOfActin_Graphics, CapturingCanvas3D, ViewerBehavior, etc.)
- **Phase 5:** Validate compilation under Java 21 with `--enable-preview --release 21`

The addendum cataloged QK (quickstate) serialization code for deletion, since it was deeply entangled with Java3D's graphics nodes and not worth preserving.

---

## Session 4 — Phase 0: Pt3D Surgery (May 2026)

**Commit:** `a2722af` "Session 4 / Phase 0: Pt3D surgery — drop Point3d inheritance, add explicit x/y/z fields"

`Pt3D` was the deepest Java3D dependency in the codebase — it extended `javax.vecmath.Point3d` and was used by every simulation class. Phase 0 converted `Pt3D` into a standalone class:

- `public class Pt3D` (no longer `extends Point3d`)
- Explicit `public double x, y, z;` fields
- All math methods rewritten to operate on these fields directly (no more inherited `Point3d.x`/`y`/`z`)
- Added `add(Pt3D vec)` (in-place) and `scale(double sc)` (in-place) methods, since the Point3d versions of these are gone

The current `Pt3D` is ~600 lines of pure Java math. No Java3D, no vecmath, no Java 3D-style transforms — all coordinate-system transforms are explicit matrix multiplications using `Thing.transXTox` / `Thing.transxToX`.

---

## Session 5 — Phase 1: Remove Class-Load-Time Triggers (May 2026)

**Commit:** `2b0c877` "Session 5 / Phase 1: remove all class-load-time Java3D triggers from Env, Thing, FilSegment, Monomer, FillNode, ProteinNode"

The class-load blocker identified in the original journal was specifically these declarations in `Thing.java`:

```java
BranchGroup G = new BranchGroup();
TransformGroup g3d = new TransformGroup();
```

These were field initializers, meaning the JVM had to resolve `BranchGroup` and `TransformGroup` symbols at class-load time, even when `-r` (headless) was set and the actual graphics methods were never called. Phase 1 removed these declarations from `Thing`, `Env`, `FilSegment`, `Monomer`, `FillNode`, and `ProteinNode`. The corresponding setup methods (`setupGraphics()`, etc.) were either stubbed or deleted.

After Phase 1, the simulation classes could be loaded without Java3D jars on the classpath, though many methods still referenced Java3D types and would fail at first call.

---

## Session 6 — Phase 2: Strip Java3D from Simulation Files (May 2026)

**Commits:** `c23e4b8` "Session 6 / Phase 2: strip all Java3D from 20 simulation files; all sim files compile and load without J3D jars" and `65566e8` "Update compiled class files for Session 6 / Phase 2"

Twenty simulation files were de-Java3D'd in this phase. After Phase 6, every file in `boxOfActin/` that participates in the simulation (as opposed to pure graphics) compiles and runs without Java3D on the classpath. Where rendering hooks remained, they were either reduced to no-op stubs (e.g., `Thing.drawYourself(Graphics, double, double[])` is now an empty AWT method) or marked for the new ThreeJSWriter pipeline.

`FilSegment.java` retains a few primitive-typed "graphics bookkeeping" fields (`updateCylGraphicsFlag`, `coordLineLength`, `xLineEndPt`, `coordSysOn`, etc.) with an inline comment confirming Phase 1's intent: `// graphics bookkeeping (primitives only; Java3D fields removed in Phase 1)`. These are vestigial and could be cleaned up in a future pass, but they don't pull in Java3D.

---

## Session 7 — Phase 3: Strip Top-Level Files (May 2026)

**Commit:** `ba97fab` "Session 7 / Phase 3: strip Java3D from BoxOfActin.java and FileOps.java; remove graphics orchestration, QK code, and Swing timer"

Phase 3 addressed `BoxOfActin.java` and `FileOps.java`:

- `BoxOfActin.parseArgs()` lost `-qk`, `-qkN`, `-ic` — all QK output and the resume-from-saved-state path. The `-help` text was rewritten to list only the surviving flags: `-r`, `-pf`, `-o`, `-outMade`, `-lf`, `-biochem`, `-3js`, `-oc`.
- The Swing timer that drove animation in the GUI was removed. The `TimeLoop` thread now runs `doLoop()` directly with no graphics callbacks.
- `main()` is currently commented out in `boxOfActin.BoxOfActin.java`; the simulation is started by the top-level `BoxOfActin.java` (default-package) calling into `boxOfActin.BoxOfActin.begin()`.
- `FileOps.java` lost all QK serialization. The Simularium JSON output (`writeSimJSonsFrame`, `writeSimJSonsFrame2`) is preserved alongside the new Three.js writer. JFileChooser is retained as a pure Swing dependency (no Java3D involvement).

After Phase 3, the entire `boxOfActin/` package compiles without Java3D jars.

---

## Session 8 — Phase 4: Delete Pure-Rendering Files (May 2026)

**Commit:** `dd4314f` "Session 8 / Phase 4: delete 21 pure-rendering files, fix Pt3D.set() and ParamGui refs. Java3D removal complete; Phase 5 (Java 21) blocked pending brew install openjdk@21."

Twenty-one files whose sole purpose was Java3D rendering were deleted outright. These included `BoxOfActin_Graphics.java`, `CapturingCanvas3D.java`, `ViewerBehavior.java`, `ExamineViewerBehavior.java`, `RenderControl.java`, `GraphicsControl.java`, `ArchShape.java`, `SphereSection.java`, `HistoPlotPanel.java`, `ParamGui.java`, `InertGuiHead.java`, and all of the `*Control.java` parameter-panel files (ActAControl, CellShapeControl, EndRatesControl, EnvControl, InitControl, MechControl, MiscRatesControl, MyoRatesControl, XLinkControl, BareButton).

Small in-scope fixes during the deletion:
- A few stray references to `Pt3D.set()` (Java 3D's setter style) were swapped for the now-canonical `Pt3D.copy()` / explicit field assignment.
- A few ParamGui references — left over from Phase 3 — were stripped from callers.

After Phase 4, the active codebase consists of:
- The top-level `BoxOfActin.java` (default package) — entry point
- 22 files in `boxOfActin/` — the simulation engine, JSON writers, mesh, parameter handling, multithreading, and small utilities
- `infoCCD/` (Info, ResourceGetter) — preserved because of one harmless reference
- `ec/util/` and `edu/cornell/lassp/houle/RngPack/` — RNG libraries, unchanged

`git status` at the end of Session 8 shows pending `.class` deletions in the working tree from the 21 deleted source files — these should be committed in a tidying pass.

The Phase 4 commit message notes: **"Java3D removal complete; Phase 5 (Java 21) blocked pending brew install openjdk@21."**

## Session 10 — Stable Thing IDs and identity-keyed viewer rendering (May 2026)

### Diagnosis (from Session 9 TELEPORT_DIAG + temporary [MINI_LIFE] prints)

With `Env.myoMiniTeleportDiag = true`, the instrumentation showed no large displacements in `moveThing()` — so the apparent "teleports" in the viewer were not a physics bug. Temporary `[MINI_LIFE]` prints in `MyoMiniFilament.cleanUpMyoMinis()` and `makeRandomMyoMiniFil()` confirmed the cause: a minifilament died (via `cleanUp`) and a new one spawned in the same timestep. The viewer, keying its InstancedMesh slots by array position, displayed the new object's position through the old object's cylinder — producing the apparent teleport. The fix is not physics; it is viewer aliasing.

This aliasing is latent in every renderable Thing subclass. Minifilaments exposed it because their lifetime (`myoMiniLifetime`, default 10 s) is short enough to produce frequent death/spawn events during a typical run. The connector classes (FilLink, NodeLink, Arp23, ActA — not Thing subclasses) have analogous cleanup patterns and may show similar viewer artifacts if they are ever rendered; left for future work.

### Fix

**`boxOfActin/Thing.java`** — Added a class-level monotonic counter and a `public final int thingInstanceId` assigned once in the `Thing` constructor before `addThing(this)`. The counter is private and static. `myThingNumber` (array-position index used by the swap-and-decrement cleanup pattern) is unchanged.

**`boxOfActin/ThreeJSWriter.java`** — Every entity JSON object now carries `"id"` as its first field:
- Segments: `fs.thingInstanceId`
- Myosins: `m.myoRod.thingInstanceId` — `Myosin` is not a `Thing` subclass, so the rod's stable ID is the canonical identifier for the rod/lever/motor composite. Each `MyoRod`, `MyoLever`, and `MyoMotor` are `Thing` subclasses.
- Minifilaments: `mf.thingInstanceId`

**`sim_viewer_boa.html`** — Converted from array-position–keyed to `id`-keyed instance management. Eight `Map` objects added at module scope:

```javascript
segIdToSlot, segSlotToId        // FilSegment
myoIdToSlot, myoSlotToId        // Myosin lever+motor (lever = canonical slot)
rodIdToSlot, rodSlotToId        // Myosin rod (separate: rod can be invisible)
miniIdToSlot, miniSlotToId      // MyoMiniFilament
```

All maps are rebuilt from scratch each frame (sequential slot assignment = compact packing). For each entity type:
- `applyFrameData` / `updateMyosinData` clear and repopulate all maps from the incoming JSON.
- Forward maps (`idToSlot`): populated for future "find slot by stable ID" use.
- Reverse maps (`slotToId`): the **picking attachment point** — when a future WebSocket-based click-to-inspect feature does `intersection.instanceId` via THREE.js raycasting, it will call `segSlotToId.get(instanceId)` (or the appropriate mesh's reverse map) to resolve the stable `thingInstanceId` and send it over the socket.

**`boxOfActin/MyoMiniFilament.java`** — Removed the temporary `[MINI_LIFE]` debug prints from `cleanUpMyoMinis()` and `makeRandomMyoMiniFil()` that were added during Session 9 diagnosis.

**`boxOfActin/Env.java`** — Flipped `myoMiniTeleportDiag` back to `false` (it was left `true` from the debug session). The field and threshold remain in place for future use; see Session 9 for the `TELEPORT_DIAG` grep/removal instructions.

### Foundation for planned click-to-inspect

`thingInstanceId` is the wire-level identifier for the future WebSocket click-to-inspect protocol:

1. User clicks a rendered object in the viewer.
2. THREE.js raycasting returns `intersection.instanceId` (a slot index).
3. Viewer resolves to stable ID: e.g., `miniSlotToId.get(intersection.instanceId)`.
4. Viewer sends `{"action": "inspect", "id": <stableId>}` over WebSocket.
5. Simulation looks up the live object by ID and returns its state.
6. If the object has since died, the lookup returns null and the viewer is told gracefully.

No WebSocket plumbing was added in this session. The Java side would also need a `Thing.findByInstanceId(int)` lookup (a static `HashMap<Integer,Thing>` or a linear scan) — that too is future work. This session only establishes the stable ID and the viewer-side identity structure.

### Connector classes (FilLink, NodeLink, Arp23, ActA)

These are not `Thing` subclasses and were not touched. Their cleanup methods (`setInactiveFilLinks`, `setInactiveNodeLinks`, `setInactiveArp23s`, `cleanUpActAs`) use similar swap-with-last patterns. If these classes are ever rendered, the same aliasing problem will appear and the same fix applies. Not rendered currently, so no action taken.

Post-Session 10 correction: the myosin composite ID was changed from m.myoRod.thingInstanceId to m.myoMotor.thingInstanceId. The motor is where the biologically interesting state lives (nucleotide cycle, on/off filament, bound actin), and is the natural raycast target for a clicked myosin. Back-references from each part (MyoMotor.myMyosin, MyoLever.myMyosin, MyoRod.myMyosin) make upward navigation in the hierarchy possible for the future inspection panel.

## Session 9 — Teleportation diagnostic instrumentation (May 2026)

### What was added

Toggleable instrumentation that catches large single-step displacements of `MyoMiniFilament` objects and emits a labeled state dump to stderr when one is detected.

**`Env.java`** — two new fields in the "Flags and Constants for Testing" section:

```java
static boolean myoMiniTeleportDiag = false;     // TELEPORT_DIAG toggle
static double  myoMiniTeleportThreshold = 0.1;  // TELEPORT_DIAG µm threshold
```

**`MyoMiniFilament.java`** — two additions:

1. The existing `moveThing()` override is wrapped with a diagnostic block. At method entry (before any force transforms), when `Env.myoMiniTeleportDiag` is true, nine `Pt3D` snapshots are taken: `coord`, `end1`, `end2`, `forceSum`, `torqueSum`, `randForces`, `randTorques`, `bTransGam`, `bRotGam`. At method exit (after `initialize()`), the displacement `Pt3D.ptDist(coordBefore, coord)` is computed; if it exceeds `Env.myoMiniTeleportThreshold`, `dumpTeleportDiag()` is called.

2. A new private method `dumpTeleportDiag(...)` formats and prints a 17-line `[TELEPORT]`-prefixed block to `System.err`. The block includes: simulation time and step counter, minifilament index (`myMyoMiniNumber`), displacement magnitude, position before/after for `coord`/`end1`/`end2`, pre-step `forceSum`/`torqueSum`/`randForces`/`randTorques`, post-integration `bForceSum`/`bTorqueSum`/`bVeloc`/`bAngVeloc`, drag tensors `bTransGam`/`bRotGam`, and `collisionCt`/`lastCollisionTime`.

Forces and velocities are formatted with `%.3e` (scientific notation) to handle the wide dynamic range.

### Toggle and threshold

| Field | Location | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `Env.myoMiniTeleportDiag` | `Env.java` line ~234 | `false` |
| `Env.myoMiniTeleportThreshold` | `Env.java` line ~235 | `0.1` µm |

Set `myoMiniTeleportDiag = true` and redirect stderr to catch events: `java -Xmx800M BoxOfActin -r ... 2>teleport.log`. Then `grep TELEPORT teleport.log` to find every event block.

Threshold of 0.1 µm is well above any physical single-step displacement (typical Brownian step for a minifilament is O(1 nm)), so false positives should be rare. Lower if events are missed; raise if noise is excessive.

### Zero overhead when disabled

All diagnostic code is inside `if (Env.myoMiniTeleportDiag)` guards. The JIT eliminates the dead branch entirely when the flag is `false`. No per-step allocation or computation occurs in the default-off state.

### How to remove later

```
grep -rn TELEPORT_DIAG boxOfActin/ *.java
```

Every instrumentation site is tagged with `// TELEPORT_DIAG`. The tag appears at:
- `Env.java` — two field declarations
- `MyoMiniFilament.java` — two comments in `moveThing()` and the `dumpTeleportDiag` method header

Removal is: delete the two fields from `Env.java`, delete the `if (Env.myoMiniTeleportDiag)` blocks from `moveThing()`, and delete the `dumpTeleportDiag` method. No other files are touched.

---

## Current Known Issues

### Phase 5 not yet started

Java 21 has not been installed on the MBP. `brew install openjdk@21` is the next step. Once Java 21 is on the system:

1. Validate compilation with `javac --release 21 --enable-preview` (no JOGLAndj3D classpath needed anymore)
2. Validate that an unmodified `-r -pf ParameterFiles/boa10-64Seg -3js <dir>` run produces the same trajectory under Java 21 as under Java 8
3. Commit the new build instructions to CLAUDE.md

After that, the path is open to TornadoVM integration on aorus (the GPU machine). The GPU plan in CLAUDE.md (preserved from earlier sessions) remains the authoritative roadmap: Step 0 SoA shadow arrays, Step 1 Brownian + integration kernel, Step 2 motor-filament search, Step 3 bounds + link + crosslink forces.

### Vestigial graphics bookkeeping fields

Several simulation classes retain primitive-typed fields (`updateCylGraphicsFlag`, `coordLineLength`, `xLineEndPt`, etc.) that survived Phase 1 as harmless stubs. These don't break anything but are dead weight; cleanup is optional and low-priority.

### `.class` files in working tree

`git status` shows pending deletions of compiled `.class` files corresponding to the source files deleted in Phase 4. These should be committed in a tidying pass — they're not affecting the simulation but they're untracked clutter.

### main() commented out in boxOfActin.BoxOfActin

`boxOfActin.BoxOfActin` has its `main()` commented out. Entry happens via the top-level (default-package) `BoxOfActin.java`, which calls `boxOfActin.BoxOfActin.begin(args)`. This works but is brittle — at some point it's worth choosing one entry point and deleting the other.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate

Install Java 21 and validate the Phase 5 compile/run on MBP. Commit the `.class` deletions and the new context docs.

### Short term

After Phase 5 validates, consider one of:

1. **Begin GPU Step 0 on aorus** — port the codebase to the Linux GPU machine, write SoA shadow arrays for FilSegments. No simulation logic changes; just enabling infrastructure for subsequent kernels. The plan in CLAUDE.md's "GPU Acceleration Strategy" section is detailed and ready to execute.

2. **WebSocket-driven live observation GUI** — replace the file-based Three.js viewer with a live socket-streamed one. This was mentioned in the project instructions as a planned direction. Lightweight design note from the project instructions: prefer a schema that describes entities by what they are dynamically (positions, orientations, link endpoints, state flags) rather than by Java class identity, which will port cleanly to v2.

3. **Vestigial cleanup** — strip the dead graphics-bookkeeping fields, settle the `main()` entry-point question, commit the `.class` deletions. Cosmetic but reduces noise for future readers.

## Workflow note

This project uses a two-Claude workflow:
- **Claude.ai Projects** (planner): architecture, strategy, debugging hypotheses, biological context, prompt generation, journal updates
- **Claude Code** (implementer): file editing, compilation, execution, multi-file refactors

Restart Claude Code at task boundaries to avoid context bloat. `CLAUDE.md` and `JOURNAL.md` carry context forward across Claude Code sessions and across the planner / Claude Code boundary. Push them to GitHub at the end of any session that changed them, so the planner's next session can fetch a current view.
